Recreating Moo

The intial plan for this project was to re-create the Moo Marketing website to have a more recent portfolio item to show to Moo Marketing.

It has evolved into more of a demonstration of my learning and development process. The DeveloperNotes document is available to read as a live ongoing record of my thought
process as I learn WordPress, React, PHP, and how each of these interact with each other inside of the WordPress ecosystem.

Unfortunately the export of the Local project is too large for me to include on GitHub. Feel free to email me for a copy, or download the unzipped project starting at the "MOO"
folder.

Final Thoughts/TODOs:
- I initially used the Customizer to deal with custom image management. I realised only in the last stretch that those pesky console errors in the JS were trying to tell me
 something. Turns out you can use attributes in the PHP comments of your patterns to deal with all that. Oh well! I did that thing anyway.
 -- TODO: Removing the Customizer and making sure everything works with attribute tags would be the way to go.
- CSS is a nightmare to use through the WordPress editor without their proprietary plugin. I can see why they are asking people to pay for it - people will pay for anything under
 duress! Fiddling with the CSS was super fun at the start becaus I love making things look neat, and then torturous after working with the Editor Styles.
 -- TODO: Keep at it champ. I can get everything to work, but my word will it take some time.
- I am a little bummed I didn't get the Typer Text Plugin to work! I doubt it was do to any inability to program on my behalf, and more due to the sheer impenetrability of
 WordPress documentation. What does my Save.js even do? What does the View.js even do? I feel like if I had someone just sit down and explain what was happening it would be A
 piece of cake. Unfortunately Googling isn't as potent a skill as it used to be. So many AI generated slop articles.
 -- TODO: Keep chipping away. Every time I came back to it I made more progress - I'm just certain I could do more with actual resources.
- It was ambitious to implement the entire site, so about halfway through I downgraded my expectations to the front page... and then to the first three sections of the front
 page. And even that was too much. Gave it my best shot though.
 -- TODO: These last three TODOs are basically the same. I can get their with more effort, but I am out of time. It is how it is.
