Recreating Moo

The inial plan for this project was to re-create the Moo Marketing website to have a more recent portfolio item to show to Moo for a job application.

It has evolved into more of a demonstration of my learning and development process. The DeveloperNotes document is available to read as a live ongoing record of my thought process as I
learn WordPress, React, PHP, and how each of these interact with each other.

If you are interested in inspecting the project, I have included an export of the Local project files that I have been using. You download these as well as Local to run the project locally.
