Recreating Moo

The inial plan for this project was to re-create the Moo Marketing website to have a more recent portfolio item to show to Moo Marketing.

It has evolved into more of a demonstration of my learning and development process. The DeveloperNotes document is available to read as a live ongoing record of my thought
process as I learn WordPress, React, PHP, and how each of these interact with each other inside of the WordPress ecosystem.

If you are interested in inspecting the project, I have included an export of the Local project files that I have been using. You download these as well as Local to run the
project locally.

Some Caveats:
- I am not paying for WordPress, so some features have been replaced with jank. Much of these features are implemented using the Customizer instead. This includes things like:
-- Updating images that are included the base theme

- I am prioritising producing a complete portfoilio item over a complete project. Features will be missing.

- I can not always stick to best practices, as I am not 100% sure what they are, and don't necessarily have the time to research them. Much of my knowledge is being picked up as
  I go.

TODO:
- Add JS to production site
- Implement remaining site structure
